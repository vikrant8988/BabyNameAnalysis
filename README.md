# BabyNameAnalysis
This project focuses on analyzing baby name trends in various regions of the United States between 1980 and 2009. By using MySQL, we explore how name popularity has changed over time, compare trends across different regions, and highlight unique names in the dataset.

# Introduction
The Baby Name Analysis project leverages MySQL for data analysis on baby names across different regions and decades. The dataset includes records from six distinct regions:

- Pacific
- Mountain
- New_England
- Mid_Atlantic
- Midwest
- New England

Our goal is to provide insights into name popularity trends from 1980 to 2009 and allow comparisons across regions and decades.

# Objectives
The key objectives of this project are:

Track changes in name popularity: Analyze how specific names have gained or lost popularity over time.
Compare popularity across decades: Identify trends and patterns in baby names across the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s.
Compare popularity across regions: Study how the popularity of names differs among regions.
Explore unique names in the dataset: Identify and explore names that are unique to specific regions or years.

# Disclamer
Due to the size of the dataset (greater than 25MB), I am unable to upload it directly to this repository. Unfortunately, GitHub limits the file size for uploads to 25MB. If you're interested in accessing the dataset, please contact me, and I will provide it to you via an alternative method.
